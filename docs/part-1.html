<p>You write a lot, he said.</p>
<p>By that time, he didn’t know what had happened with him along all those years. He didn’t know the places where he had been, lost; the languages he had forgotten, and those he hadn’t learnt; the women that kept his hopes, and those he hadn’t loved; the friends he hadn’t visit, and therefore had disappeared; the wasted time scrolling people up and down…</p>
<p>As it is supposed, it started with isolation. The uncomfortable feeling of being alone. Nevertheless, in some sense, he had created those situations. The suffering needed for evolving was his most intimate creation. Full of pain, full of hopes. Depending on the audience, depending on the artist, depending on the piece of art, depending on the critics, depending on the art itself. It was what it was. The present moment transformed in the uneasiness of a foreigner who, willingly, missed his home, if there was any.</p>
<p>Then he stopped. At that moment, he sipped the tea. Slowly, calmly, savoring the presence of the room, breathing the essence of life. Why did their thoughts have to invade these moments? Why couldn’t the peace last forever? It had happened again.</p>
<p>He turned on the laptop searching for answers. The machine stole his life during the initialization. Impatiently, he looked a bug flying among the lost seconds of his desk. The speed of technology would never be enough for the unsatisfied human brain. Without any particular reason, looking to that bug he remembered that day. The day he met her.</p>
<p>She was just doing it for love. Sometimes she liked to stare at people who were waiting. What do people do when they do not have anything else to do? The expressive faces and grimaces reflecting their inner fights; the self-grooming behaviors as attempts in search of lost time. She used to encounter the most creative people while scrutinizing their spare time. It seemed to her that repressed artist disclosure their best works without being aware. Interestingly, creations that appear conscientiously usually end unpublished. As it was her case. As it was his case.</p>
<p>She could have written more. However, she used paper in a personal way. The silky blankness of new sheets was her favorite way of procrastination. Streams of thoughts were missing in exchange for the pleasurable feeling of observing her fingers sliding smoothly over the satin cellulose.</p>
<p>Anyhow, she loved those waiters. That is how she liked to call them. She also loved curious words. Why the waiters are called waiters when are the clients those who complain about being waiting? Waiting for the waiters… It may not have sense, but she always lost her attention with these kinds of thoughts.</p>
<p>Thinking about attention, he remembered he was waiting for the laptop to light up, a task that had been completed several minutes ago. Where was now the unbeatable human brain? He typed the password and wait again while the screen was loading. Now, it was the blackness of the screen what led him to the subsequent thoughts.</p>
<p>He recalled her complaining about how people had stopped waiting. Her loved waiters had become watchers. They had stopped creating to gaze uninterruptedly at a black mirror. People were sinking in their own reflection. The unavoidable narcissism that, as was later demonstrated and against all the forecasting, would lead humankind to its vital awakening. Regardless of the height of the fall, the brain knows how to finish the nightmare just moments before crashing against the concrete.</p>
<p>She became mad at it, and for boosting her mood, she usually went to hostels to see strangers sleep. That was her second hobby. That way, she managed to avoid the guilty feelings experienced when gawking hard-workers. By listening to the moans and wails of the room she could guess if someone would have to change their underpants the next morning. She had become an expert in inner conversations. After hundreds of unexpected encounters in the dark, and through conscientious and delicate practice, she was able then to maintain profound dialogues with somnambulist and sleep talkers. Again, words. Sometimes arbitrary, sometimes not. Whatever the case, she decided what to do with her time. Time is a personal decision. Waiting is just an option. Sleep is another.</p>
<p>He recovered his mind and looked at the screen, now colorful and full of possibilities. Maybe, too many possibilities.</p>
<p>Through his pupils, the LCD was draining his brain. The basic question remained in his head, what was he looking for? Was it himself? Was how to maintain endurable and fruitful relationships? Was how to kill the tiny flies attracted by the over-matured fruit that accumulated in his room? Were techniques to not to lose his attention? Whatever it was, his fingers opened Facebook. He saw his profile photo, he saw his friends’ pictures, he saw the video of a guy killing flies with an electrified racquet. If it weren’t because he had already forgotten about what he was looking for, Facebook could have become the most effective tool.</p>
<p>Another hour was gone, fortunately, this time without pain, this time without feeling. After bombing his mind with stimulation, his memory just retained the video of the dying flies and that photo, taken five long years ago. He wrote down in the To Buy List “Electrified racquet”. He took the coat, opened the door and went to the street. He would take the bike; the last experience with public transport could not be considered as very encouraging.</p>
<p>That photo had become another burden on his heart. He had not decided to see it. As it had faded away, it had just appeared on the screen. Regrettably, it remained in his mind. He had neither possibilities nor freedom of election. He was imposed to watch what other people want him to watch. The printed copy of the picture awaited in his shoebox, hidden for five years now.</p>
